## About
The primary objective of this investigation is to perform a revised final design upon a CAD modelled bracket structural member. Furthermore, the revised design of the part is to ultimately have a reduction upon maximum stress endured by the bracket when undertaking specified load and torque conditions. These conditions are highlighted below, alongside requirements of the design that this report will follow. 

Specifications:
- Factor of Safety > 1.5 & < 3.0. 
- Load 2𝑘𝑁 
- Torque 200𝑁𝑚 
- Aluminium Alloy Material
  
Requirements:
- Mass is not Increased ≤ 166.98𝑔
- Final mass ideally reduced by a percentage factor of original.  
- Bolt Holes must be constrained.  
- Relative positions of the Main Bore & Bolt Holes. 
- 12mm Unbrako Socket Head Cap Screw used for reference.  
- Selection of a suitable Manufacturing Method.

Assumptions: 
- CAD Software used for Design – Solidworks 2019. 
- Mass Production of Bracket Component. 
- Cost is a Priority.
