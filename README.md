## About
The primary objective of this investigation is to perform a revised final design upon a CAD modelled bracket structural member. Furthermore, the revised design of the part is to ultimately have a reduction upon maximum stress endured by the bracket when undertaking specified load and torque conditions. These conditions are highlighted below, alongside requirements of the design that this report will follow.
